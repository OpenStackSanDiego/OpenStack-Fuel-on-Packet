# OpenStack-Fuel-on-Packet


## Overview


## Bare Metal Service Account

For this workshop, you'll be using physical servers provided by Packet. Specifically, you'll be using one of their 'Type 1' servers, a 32 GB, 120GB x 2 SSD (RAID-1), 4 core Xeon server. Packet provides their servers by the hour. With code SDOPENSTACK, you'll get $25 of free credit. The 'Type 1' is $0.40/hour so the $25 credit will get you 62 hours of CPU use. Be sure to shut down the server at the end of the workshop!

Sign up at www.packet.net and use code SDOPENSTACK. You'll need to provide a credit card or PayPal account in case you go past the $25 in credit.
